# Lil' Digger

Lil Digger is my submission for Ludum Dare 39.

Lil Digger is for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

## Story

You're running out of enegy.  Go spelunking for Energy Crystals.  You'll need
to collect keys to open doors, and watch out for snakes and spiders!
Collect gold for extra points.  Blue flags are checkpoints, red flags are
the end of the level.

This game takes quite a bit of inspiration from Atari Pitfall and Pitfall II.

Meta: The theme for "LD39" is "Running out of Power". The NES hardly has any
power to begin with!

## How to Play

This game is for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  In order to play it
you will need either an emulator or a real NES with a flash cart (such as
an Everdrive).

I've tested on *fceux* and with an *Everdrive* on a real NES.

## Contols

* D-Pad - left/right, climb ladders.
* A button - jump
* Start - start game or pause game.
